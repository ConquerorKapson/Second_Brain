# AI Personal Memory Architect — ADK Project Skeleton

This repository is a **production-grade skeleton** for an ADK-based project: *AI Personal Memory Architect (Your Second Brain)*.

It includes:
- ADK-friendly agent structure (root agent, sub-agents, tools)
- Vector DB & Graph DB connectors (placeholders)
- FastAPI + Streamlit quickstart UI
- Docker & docker-compose for local dev
- CI pipeline skeleton and testing structure

**Instructions**
1. Unzip and open the `src/` directory to explore agents and tools.
2. Replace placeholder implementations with your code.
3. Use `docker-compose.yml` for local dev (Weaviate, Neo4j, Postgres placeholders).
4. See `docs/` for ADK conventions and deployment notes.
